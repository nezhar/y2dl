# Youtube to MP3 Download

A simple bash script that uses [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl) and [ffmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg) to download videos and extract the audio as mp3 using bash in Ubuntu/Linux.

### Usage

Make sure you have **youtube-dl** and **ffmpeg** installed:

```
sudo apt-get install youtube-dl ffmpeg
```

After that you have to define the videos you want to download in the **download-list.txt** file and that run the script:

```
./y2dl
```
